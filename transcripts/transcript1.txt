I don't know, say something else. Hello, can you hear me now? Yeah, we can probably hear you quite well. So... So, that's quite neat. That's not true. So, today we're playing, write some recipes. So, they're nice and written down. So, what I suggest that we do here, I've got the meals that work card up here. Yeah. If one of us, it could be you, probably different others for different recipes, can go through these recipes. And I guess if you're talking about the recipe, it probably helps if you look towards, look to have your shoulder. Okay. Speak this way rather than not your phone. Okay. And try to describe the recipe just as sort of effectively as possible. So, I'll go first, cos then it'll make... I thought they made what to do. Mm-hmm. What's our very Tim recipe here? So, when we make burgers, the first thing to start doing is to chop potatoes into make some wedges. So, we need to do that first, the very important first thing. We need to chop them into chips, like three, three chop them into quarters, skin on fries. Don't have to be that big. If we've got sweet potatoes, chop some of them in as well. Come on, fucking love sweet potatoes. So, that's pretty good. So, there's James. And James. So, there we go. And then get them in the oven at like 180C and they need 40 minutes. Now, you've got time to gather and sort out all the shit for the other ingredients. But they tend to need to be on in the next 20 minutes. So, you've got to work rapidly so now to make that happen. So, the other ingredients that you need to search out are Halumi, mushrooms, chicken, burgers. So, all of these items probably take about 20 minutes. This is assuming that the chicken is thawed. So, if it ain't thawed, you better be unthoring it faster, bro. So, thawed. Or it can get from frozen in half, in about half an hour. Or you can cook it from frozen in about half an hour. So, the Beyond Meat Burgers are gluten free, so they technically could be on the same tray as the mushrooms. The mushrooms on the Beyond Meat Burgers probably want to be in the oven for 20 minutes. The chicken also probably wants to be in the oven at about 180 for 20 minutes. You can just put them on baking trays and put them in the oven. Maybe you sprinkle a little bit of oil over the mushrooms. And you'll probably have wanted to sprinkle a bit of oil over the potato for wedges too. When it comes to the Halumi, probably the easiest way of doing it, I've found is to put it in the big frying pan. And fry it for about six minutes. But you probably want to start at minus ten minutes, or ten, two minus ten minutes, because something will not quite work right. Things we need on the table are mayo, aioli, chilli mayo, bread rolls for Tim, gluten free bread rolls for Jan. Water, plates, teaspoons, big spoons, salt and pepper. If there are rottomatoes, Tim would like a rottomato. If there's black ram, don't provide that too. Yeah, if there's black ram, spread thing, don't provide that. It could also be worth bringing a block of cheese and a cheese grater, especially if we're missing one of the key ingredients. It also can be easier to plate up in the kitchen, so leaving all the plates in the kitchen and then bringing the things onto the top of the cooker. It's probably easier with the number of trays that might well exist at this point. James will eat basically everything, especially hurling me. Hi. Do you want to do it? Come on. Right then. Spreeflays a bit complicated one and does take a while. So, first things first, you need to grate your courgettes into a pan and stick them on a medium heat for maybe 10 minutes. Then stick in some frozen spinach. You're going to end up with a total later about 500 grams. But basically you cook it until most of the water is disappeared because of the way that it's really sloppy. So that's probably going to take the best part of an hour into it. The next part of the process is to boil some pasta because we're making it gently. We always use a bit of free one. So whatever the instructions are on the packet plus about two minutes. The rest becomes 500 grams. We've never done it with that metal. Next step is to make a very thick white sauce. So 50 grams of plain flour, 50 grams of butter and 300 ml of milk in a pan and whisk until the way I do it is to put the milk in the pan, put the flour in the pan, whisk until it's combined. Then put the heat on and put the butter in and just keep whisking until it thickens up, which it will do shortly off the butter if melted. Cook that for a couple of minutes once it gets really thick. Then take it off the heat and add the spinach mixture and load it goes cheese. Again, the recipe calls for 150 grams but we use probably twice that at least to make it nice and cheesy. Then comes a thumb bit with the eggs so you need to separate it. The recipe calls for three separated eggs plus an extra white. So the yolks go in the spinach, the sauce mixture and the egg whites go in the bowl separately to be whisked once they're sort of at least soft peaks so once you can lift the bowl over your head and it doesn't fall out of the bowl. Then fold them into the sauce mixture carefully, gently and then these where I've found to them dish as I've put this into dishes is to pour a bit of the mixture into some of the pyrex round castamels. Then put some pasta in and sort of amalgamate that to then pour more extra in the top of that. It makes it under 80 for something like 35 minutes and then we're really faking hot so it takes a bit of time to cook them. Yeah, it's a nice recipe but it doesn't. That's briefly. So I'll just do our 10 curry recipes so this is a really good quick one. You can probably prepare it in about 15 minutes. The first thing to do is to boil the kettle. The second thing to do is to pour some rice into a pan. The nice thing about rice is that we'll probably eat it on a different day if you cook too much and it's really cheap. So maybe like a mug and a half of rice or if you insist on measuring it or you can just plate it by ear into a pan. Don't put a specific amount of water into it just like pour some water over it so that they're covered and there's a bit more water and set a timer for 12 minutes. So the point of this, the way we're doing the rice today is that we are sticking to that timer. We're going to make sure that about 10 minutes we're tasting the rice so you should be able to taste whether or not the rice is too crunchy or not. If it's too crunchy, it needs a bit more time. If it's at 10 minutes and it's dry, it needs some more water. If it gets to 12 minutes, it's too crunchy. It needs some more water, not a lot of water, just a little bit of more water. Anyway, eventually, probably sometime around 12, 13 minutes, you'll have evaporated all the water and you will also have some rice so that'll be nice. The curry takes, not very long at all, so for 2.5 people, I think we need three tins of curry. These can be of the same type, these can be different types. These can be the only things we have available. Try and make up a combination that seems to make sense to you and be ready to defend it furiously. There is in fact a card on Trello with the different taste of all the different curries, but they all seem to have a fair amount of variation in how spicy they are so your mileage may vary. Next recipe. I actually have some ingredients for this written down. Tim and I differ in our ways of pairing this dish. No, I just do yours. I need to defrost some spinach so that can be done in the microwave in a single pot. Combine the defrosted spinach with ricotta, at least one tub, probably two and at least one pack of... Feta or fake feta that's all crumbled up. First things first, I think I have a lot to say at the beginning, you need to make some tomato sauce. I find that they're not stupidly cheap tomatoes. It's best for this because you get a bit of sauce with them. But basically you want to reduce the water quantity in your tomatoes anyway. Open a couple of tins of tomatoes into a pan and stick them on a low heat to boil away for half an hour or 40 minutes. Season that to taste. It's all I like. Garlic oil, Italian spice, dried spice, so it doesn't have a bit of salt and pepper. Then layer up your lasagna basically. So you've got a sort of... your quartet mixture can be like your pasta and the ricotta and spinach mixture is then like your filling. So layery layery, layery, finish with some tomato sauce and then some grated cheese on the top. And that goes in the oven for about 30-40 minutes at 180. Should've been a nice and delicious and bubbly. It will tolerate cooking for longer and it won't be dangerous if it's cooked for a bit less. It's quite a big of a recipe actually. There have been all sorts of variations produced over the last couple of years with different spice next to them and different cheeses. Again, quite a big recipe, can tolerate stuff. Let's talk about one of the most complex recipes, baked potatoes. So I don't really get why people call things that you eat with baked potatoes toppings because they don't just go on them, they sometimes go under them. But some favourites around here include tuna, cheese, grated cheese, cottage cheese, baked beans. Chop tomatoes, maybe sweet corn. In terms of how much to cook, I would say that if you budgeted two potatoes for Tim, one and a half potatoes for Jen and one potato for James, then you'd probably be doing all right and if you added a spare one just for the pot, then you'd probably be doing well. You can do them in the microwave for some amount of time as long as you don't do them for too long. Start with five minute bursts and then you can turn them over and check them and then stick them back onto five minutes. Do not start your small potato for 15 minutes or back things will happen. Wrap them in kitchen rolls so that the moisture kind of stays close to them and they're super heated and try not to burn your fingers. If you're not sure when the person, if you don't need them instantly and you're not sure when the person who's kind of coming home is going to arrive, you can do them half in the microwave and then put them in the oven at say 180 and leave them there almost indefinitely or certainly for like 45 minutes of uncertainty time and it's quite forgiving like that. So if you have a meal where you're not sure when someone's coming home or when that meal needs to be, this is a really good one to kind of allow that to be some flexibility there. And provide a really wholesome meal which everyone will enjoy. Jen, would you like to do cauliflower cheese? Since I keep fucking it up. Okay, cauliflower cheese, you need two constituent parts, some cauliflower and some cheese sauce. So, cauliflower, well, I wash my vegetables to see if you do that less often. Yes, wash your vegetables and then pull a part or chop into fairly evenly sized florets which are about a bit bigger than the baby's hand basically. And then boil those for, if they're quite big, maybe five or six minutes, if they're fairly small and four or five. And poke them with a knife, check that they're soft enough, you don't want them completely falling apart because that'll just be sad. And while that's happening, you make some cheese sauce, set about the pint of milk in a pan and a couple of heat tablespoons of plain flour. Again, gluten free in this house, I'll beat that in, whisk that in rather more. Add about the same quantity of butter and keep whisking while that melts in. And then there's also thicken up over the next minute or two. What's it, nice and thick, give it another minute or two to cook through. Salt and pepper are in a sheet load of grated cheese, taste it, check it's okay. Once your cauliflower is cooked, drain it really well, let it dry out and then pour it into an of improved dish of some description, one of the parrots is all one of the croquins, pour this also at the top, add a bit more grated cheese and then shove it in the oven at 180 for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is melted and the edges are bubbly. And then set. I tend not to add all of the stock and all of the leaves, but it's all part of the plant. So the leaves will definitely take longer to cook than the plants, because they are fairly tough. But yeah, they can certainly be included as part of it. Super. So when it comes to meals like pizza, this is another go-to friendly classic. Jen needs pizzas from Azda, which are gluten free and can be procured at a good price. She likes to have with her pizza. I vary, so I have had them recently, just a load of cheese. I have had them with douche cheese and honey, with spinach and an egg, with ham and mushroom. Yeah, so I tend to add to my pizza, but it depends on what's in the fridge based. Smashing. Tim largely likes his pizzas with extra cheese. If we have any extra onions, he will have a small onion or a half an onion chopped up on the pizza, probably on top of the cheese or something. Tim might also like a sliced tomato on top of his pizza. Tim probably prefers two non-breds from Tesco rather than a pizza. Yeah, that's probably... Tim doesn't need tomato paste on his non-breds, he can eat them neat. So, Thai Curry. Number one thing with Thai Curry is that there's a lot of chopping to do and stuff. So try and schedule some prep time in before... And actually, you can get it on the hub and sort of boil it and let it steep and stuff and it just improves up to a point. Another way to reduce the cooking time is to microwave most of the veg before you shove it in. Because the usage is heat to let go and then it will be really faster. So, first of all, you're going to need some button at squash probs. One of the ways that you can acquire some button at squash is with frozen button at squash. Alternatively, you can roast a button at squash for... You can chop a button at squash into chunks. And drop them in some in some oil in a baking tray for about 40 minutes. And if they're kind of like squishy and you can easily slide an eye through them, they're bummer, they're sorted, they're brilliant, banging. So, you're going to need a Thai Curry pouch, you're going to need two tins of coconut milk, you're going to need some rice, you're probably going to want some water chestnut slices. Some cashews, some spinach, this can be fresh all frozen. You could have some broccoli, you could have some onion, you could have a little bit of mushroom if you'd like. Basically, most veg that you got knocking around, especially the stuff that looks like it should have been thrown away several days ago, you can probably whack it in. But moderation is probably a key because you're going to be making quite a lot of food already. And the wok we have is not that big. Which is the problem that comes from any... it becomes a problem fairly cooking and you can't steer it. So, with Thai Curry, you want to drop some of the paste into the wok with a bit of oil and just fry it up a little bit. And then pull some of the thingy milk in, coconut milk into the wok and drop any of the stuff that you have that you think will take the longest to cook into the thing. So, this might be some stems of some broccoli, this might be some carrot bits, this might be... Whatever you have that you think is probably like the toughest, roughest, biggest, baddest, horribleest, nastiest thing. Just drop that in first. So, drop those in, cook them a little bit and then you can probably just start loving other shit into the thing. So, you can drop in the butternut squash, that probably won't be the longest thing, you can drop in the spinach. Again, it won't really mind being kind of boiled too much, it'll just disintegrate. You can drop in any broccoli you have, you can drop in, basically anything you want. To be honest, if you want to drop in, you probably do a little bit better to just leave it bubbling away for a little bit now. You can pour in another half of your coconut milk, and if you've got any extra coconut magic, you could drop this in now. And probably around about now, you're going to want to get your rice on. So, your rice is going to take 12 minutes, you're going to boil a kettle, you're going to put the rice in the pan. I recommend about a mug and a half full, but you can improvise to whatever mechanism you like. And I'm going to half full of rice with a water covering it and boiling a bit. That's going to kind of cook nicely, you want to set a timer for that for 12 minutes though. And if you're coming up towards like 10 minutes and the water's no longer covering the rice, give it a taste. If it's feeling a bit crunchy, pour some more water over it so it covers the top. If it comes up to 12 minutes, give it a rice of taste, it's feeling a bit crunchy, pour some more water over the top. If it comes up to 13 minutes, you're like shipped, still taste a bit crunchy, pour some more water over it, bubble it a bit more. It comes up to 14 minutes and it tastes good, take it off the heat, and serve it up with everything else. Going back to the Thai curry, you're going to want to drop in in the last like five minutes. One or two handfuls of cashews, all of the water chestnuts and any other last minute ingredients that you can think of to drop in. And that's it, you'll need to get the gluten-free soy sauce and the normal soy sauce. And Jen might enjoy the plum-sharwoods-sauce thing. And I think that's it. Jen. I think we have had it with prawn crackers once or twice a bit. Yeah. They are not a requirement. Would you like to explain fajitas? Yes, so what you're going to need is some feathers. I think we need about eight or nine for the two of us plus the small, if we're hungry, some gloomy, some cheese, some sour cream, some chicken. That's about it, really. Okay, so you chop your peppers into strips and bun them in the oven with some oil and some feed spice, which you have a little jar. At about 200 or about 35 to 40 minutes. Check on the rice often though, so they're not completely annihilated. And while that's cooking, you get some of the rest of the stuff. So chicken thighs take about, sorry, a defrosted chicken thigh takes about 20 minutes to cook at 180. So if the oven's not 200, it's going to be about 17 or 18 minutes. They can go in a Pyrex casserole lid or some sort of cake tin. I want to bake you sheet that's actually coming. The gloomy can either go, it can be sliced and then either put in the oven for about 15 minutes or be fried in a big frying pan with a bit of oil for about five or six minutes. It may again be easier to plate up in the kitchen, just because there are a lot of pans and things to serve. So you've got your three hot things, so your peppers, your chicken and the halloumi, to dish up your meat, sour cream, cheese, and a greater, obviously nice hot spoons. Yeah, that's perfect, I think. Cool, so, beetroot risotto. Do you want to see that one? Please, a few. Okay, so for beetroot risotto, you need risotto rice. I think we have about 300 grams between the two of us, and small having some, which is just over half a box. You also need some, well, we've been using cooked beetroot for a while now, so the vacuum form packs. So you need small packs, so we tend to use two. I'll do a much bigger pack, so you're going to need one of those. So if you're using an onion, you chop your onion into small pieces, and fry that in some, as well amount of oil, with some amount of butter, until it's translucent, which will take for eight to ten minutes. Once you hit translucent, throw in all your rice, give it a good stir, get it covered in the oil, once that is nice and hot. You can chuck in a glass of white wine, if there isn't, it doesn't matter, don't worry about it. Add half a cup of boiling water, and a stock pot. That will melt over time, but it can need, if somebody's a bit of encouragement, for the disintegration. Because you don't want it melted to the bottom of the pan. Stir everything very well, and add more water, as you go along, not too much at any one time. The whole thing will take about 15 to 18 minutes to cook, once you've started adding water to the rice. First lot of beetroot, I tend to put in about ten minutes, at about ten minutes, grated well, and all the juice that comes in the packet. And then I would tend to put in the other packet, as you're coming towards the end of the cooking time. You want your rice to be pretty soft, but not completely mushy, and it needs to be stirred all the way through, because otherwise it will stick. Add salt and pepper, check that's easy, and then serve that with sour cream and goat cheese. Don't give them goat cheese to start with, they'll just eat that, make them hit some result so first. Yes, it will stone your hand, but it will not be for long. It's marvelous. It's delicious, isn't it? I'll do veggie chili, veggie chili by Tim's recipe. So first of all, you're going to need a fuck ton of food, get yourself some, and be prepared to make a fuck ton of food. Make sure that you've got some celery, a rugby team of hungry people to feed. One large red bell to a pepper, two medium sized carrots, a lot of paprika, a lot of ground cumin. Basically, those two spices you can't over do, I seriously mean that. The recipe must here massively under does it, so you need three tablespoons of each to be honest. Maybe two tablespoons of ground cumin and two tablespoons of paprika. You're going to need a teaspoon of dried oregano. You're going to need two tins of chopped tomatoes and three tins of some sort of different pulses things. Black beans, red beans, yellow beans, beans in water, beans in chili sauce. I recommend going into the shop and having a look at what's cheap and what's nice. If you're in Aldi, then it's probably everything. Anyway, get one of each different bean, don't get three cans of the same things because you're not super boring. You're also going to need a bay leaf and it probably helps to have like some avocado or some tortilla chips and some cheese or some sour cream or some grated cheddar cheese. It's ready to go with this thing but you could also garnish it with rice or jacket potatoes. Like many of these, this is a dish that all of the work is in the prep and then the cooking can take as long or largely as short as you want. So find one of our biggest pans, put some oil in the bottom, drop a chopped onion, a chopped bell pepper, a chopped carrot, all the chopped celery and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt in and stir and combine it basically for like 10 to 7 minutes, 7 to 10 minutes. It's like just keep stirring it and make the veg nice and kind of like sauteed. Then add some garlic, some chili powder. Now with chili powder, you probably don't want to add that much. This isn't a meal that is improved actually by chili, it's probably weakened by chili. So be particularly careful with more spicy versions of chili. I'd recommend like a teaspoon of chili and then like two tablespoons of smoked paprika or paprika and a bit of oregano and two tablespoons of cumin. You can't overdo it on the cumin honestly. You'll just make it, it says like cook it for about a minute and that's probably a great idea. Now with the chopped tomatoes and the beans, you can probably just don't bother draining any of them, just empty all of them into the pot. Because this is probably like an effective way of doing it. So if the beans come in water, just like bang that all in, bush bash. And let it kind of come to a simmer if you want. If you want, you could add some stock pot at this point to kind of extra add to the flavor and starch of it all. This would be the right moment to do that. So keep stirring it, don't let it stick to the bottom. Cook it probably for about 30 minutes or until you feel it's done. This could be longer than 30 minutes, that's not a problem. Just don't let it stick to the bottom. So if you need to lower the heat then that's fine. Honestly, if you needed to kind of like leave this now for a couple of hours before you eat it, that would be fine. Take it off from the chili, from the heat sorry and ideally use like a stick blender to blend some proportion of it. Now you might like it blended super fine or you might like it blended more thick. Blend it to whatever you think is the right blendedness. Which may or may not be, may super consist consistency or crunchy consistency, it doesn't really matter. Give it a stir, give it a taste. You might want to choose to add a little bit of vinegar or a bit of salt and serve it up. This will keep for some time. And yeah, it's a really kind of filling, easy dish that can feed large groups quite easily. Jane, have you got any recipes you'd like to add? No, did you say you don't like the food coming in? What was the recipe you just did today? Entry ladders. Would you like to feel that? You need a packet of Entry ladders to start. Okay, yeah, what can you do that? Right, so tonight I went to Entry ladders, you need something for the filling. So today I did three peppers that I chucked into short strips and fried with some oil and a little bit of a heaters spice. You need a... Also I did some letto rice and a tin of sweet corn. You need an Entry ladder kit, a gluten free Entry ladder kit. I think this one came from Aldi, which contains a pack of gluten free tortillas and two sorts of sauce. I mixed it with filling with a bit of the cooking sauce from the packet. And then built my Entry ladders with it. So you take the tortilla, they all have to go... All the tortillas have to go in the microwave just to make sure they're nice and soft. Then you take the tortilla, you put some of the filling in it, sprinkle a bit of cheese on and then pop it in a dish. So I used the big, the big, the big obron pyrex that we've got. And eight Entry ladders will go in side by side, quite neatly. There was a little bit of extra filling left, so I plunked that at one end of all of the... My little field of tortillas. The packet contains a creamy topping sauce that got just all over the top. And then a shed load of grated cheddar got shut on top of that. And I baked it at an engine 80 for about 15 minutes. And it was better tasty. We had it with tortilla chips the night. It could be quite nice with salad. Too light and things up a little bit. Or if you wish to storage it further, it could be done with chips or wedges. Do you want to tell us how you make pylates? Oh, pylates are a snack that James likes lots. And I like to, for breakfast, before we're going to work. These are called pylates, pylates, little pylates. Yeah, pylate, any double tea, rather than pylate. Oh, right. Or something like that. So, take two ripe bananas, mash them well, add a mug of gluten-free oats. Obviously two are bold with the bananas. And two eggs. And some sort of liquid. I've done them with kombucha when I've had some bread, with milk, with water, with fruit juice. And they all kind of taste the same in the end. So add some sort of wet. I've done several variations on themes, so I've done, sorry, start. So you mix your ingredients together with whatever liquid you're using. And then leave it for about an hour so that the oats absorb the liquid. And then you can add whatever other ingredients you're using. And pour them extra into the silicon bun tins. And bake them at 180 for about 30 to 35 minutes, depending on how well they are. So, recipe variations I have done. I have done carrot cake one, so I had a grated carrot, a wheat yogurt cinnamon. They came out quite nicely, but they needed a bit longer to cook because they were quite soggy. You can add, I've added peanut butter as protein sauce, just into the mix. And then do those ones with either raspberries or blueberries. You can use frozen ones but they tend to be a bit soggy, so I would tend to defrost the fruit that you're using in the mix. And again, they hold together better if you put a bit of butter in the bun tins. Then put the fruit on them, put more butter on the top, above me. Another variation I've done is adding other fruits I've added but not. So I added apples, I've added pears, grated up, I've added, I've done blueberries or blackberries, or raspberries as the fruit in sort of hole in them. And I've done some with the butter and a layer of either cashew or almond butter and then more butter on the top. They tend to take a bit less time to cook because they're a bit smaller than the ones with fruit in. Let them cool completely in the tin, in the bun tin before trying to get them out because if you try to get them out in the hot, they'll just fall apart. And then stick them in a tap water and in the fridge and they'll keep for 5-6 days if they're not all being eaten by them. They're really easy and don't like to help you to mix them. Can I do a rest of your breakfasts, work breakfast then? So my standard work breakfast is some Greek yogurt in a tap water pot with a dessert spoon of peanut butter and a small squeeze of honey. With some fruit added to it, which is very often blueberry, I like them. And then granola. It's one of the things that I like. It's sprinkling of granola added as the last thing before I leave for work so it's still crunchy when I get to eat it. Can you think of any more recipes to add?
