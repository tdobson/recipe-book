I don't know, say some fails. Hello, see you in the name. Yeah, we can probably hear you quite well. So... So that's quite neat. Thanks. So today we're playing... ...right some recipes. Oops, oops, oops. So, nice and written down. So what I suggest that we do here, I've got the meals that work cut up here. If one of us could be you, ...but probably different offers for different recipes, can go through these recipes. And I guess if you're talking about the recipe, it'd probably help if you look towards... ...look to your shoulder. Let's hope this way, rather than like a phone. Okay. And try to describe... ...the recipe... ...just as sort of an affected layers possible. So I'll go first, because then it'll make... ...and I'll sort of then make what to do. What's a very thin recipe here? So in... ...when we make burgers... ...we... ...the first thing to start doing is to chop potatoes... ...into make some wedges. So we need to do that... ...first... ...the very important first thing. We need to chop them into... ...chips... ...like three... ...three... ...chop them into quarters... ...skin on fries... ...they'll have to be that big. If we've got sweet potatoes... ...chop some of them in as well... ...can fucking love sweet potatoes... ...so that's pretty good. And James... ...so... ...there we go... ...and then get them in the oven at like 180C... ...and they need 40 minutes... ...now you've got time to gather and sort out all the shit... ...for the other ingredients. But they tend to need to be on in the next 20 minutes... ...so you've got to work... ...rappity somewhere to make that happen. ...the other ingredients that you need to search out... ...are... ...halimi... ...mushrooms... ...chicken... ...probably take about 20 minutes... ...this is assuming that the chicken is... ...thawed... ...so if it ain't thawed... ...you better be... ...unthawing it fast so bro... ...and so... ...thaw... ...or it can get from frozen in about half an hour... ...or you can cook it from frozen in about half an hour... ...so... ...the Beyond Meatburgers are gluten-free... ...so they technically could be on the same tray as the mushrooms... ...and the Beyond Meatburgers probably want to be in the oven for 20 minutes... ...the chicken also probably wants to be in the oven at about 180... ...for 20 minutes. You can just put them on baking trays and put them in the oven... ...maybe sprinkle a bit of oil over the mushrooms... ...and you'll probably have wanted to sprinkle a bit of oil over the potato... ...for wedges too. When it comes to the halimi, probably the best easiest way of doing it... ...I found is to put it in the big frying pan... ...and fry it for about six minutes... ...but you probably want to start at minus 10 minutes... ...or 10 to minus 10 minutes... ...because something will not work right. Things we need on the table... ...are mayo... ...aoli... ...chilli mayo... ...bread rolls for Tim... ...blooting free bread rolls for Jen... ...water plates, teaspoons, big spoons... ...salt and pepper... ...if there are rotomatoes, Tim would like a rotomatoe... ...if there's black ground and red white noctin... ...if there's black ground and breadthing... ...can would like that... ...could also be with bringing out... ...block of cheese and cheese grater... ...especially if we're missing one of the key ingredients... ...it also can be easier to plate up in the kitchen... ...so leaving all the plates in the kitchen... ...and then bring the things onto the top of the cooker... ...which is probably easier with the number of trays... ...that might well exist at this point. James will eat basically everything. Especially, honey me. Hi. Do you want to do? Um... ...right then... ...smooth taste a bit complicated one... ...and does take a while. So, first things first, you need to... ...greatly cause it's into a pan... ...and stick them on... ...that's a really rich heat... ...for... ...and the 10 minutes... ...and then stick in some frozen spinach... ...you can run it with a total of about 500 grams... ...but basically you cook it until most of the water is disappeared... ...because the weather gets really salty. So that's probably going to take the best part of an hour... ...into... ...the next part of the process is to boil some pasta... ...because we're making it generally... ...we're going to use a bit of free one... ...so whatever the instructions are on the packet... ...to 2 minutes. The recipe calls 500 grams... ...we've never done it with that little ever. Next step is to make a very thick white sauce... ...so 50 grams of plain flour... ...50 grams of butter and 300 grams of milk... ...in a pan and whisk until... ...that the way I do it is to put the milk in the pan... ...put the flour in the pan, whisk until it's combined... ...then put the heat on and put the butter in... ...and just keep whisking until it thickens up... ...which it will do shortly after the butter has melted. Could that for a couple of minutes once it gets really really thick... ...and add the spinach mixture... ...and load a great cheese. Again, the recipe calls for 150 grams... ...but we use probably twice that at least... ...and to make it nice and cheesy... ...and then comes a thumb up of the eggs... ...so you need to separate... ...it must be calls for three separated eggs... ...plus an extra white. So the eggs yolks go in the spinach and sauce mixture... ...and the egg whites go in the bowl separately to be whisked... ...once the... ...once the at least soft peaks... ...so what you can lift the bowl over your head and doesn't fall out of the bowl... ...you have to fold them into a sauce mixture... ...carefully, gently... ...and then these who are round to them... ...dish, as I've put this into dishes, is to pour a bit of the mixture into... ...some of the pyrarchs round castles... ...and then put some pasta in and sort of... ...and margarate that, then pour more extra of the top of that... ...it wakes up at 180 for something like 35 minutes... ...and then we'll be really faking hot, so... ...it takes a bit of time to cool down. Yeah, it's a nice recipe, but it doesn't... ...let's do that. So I'll just do our 10 curry recipes, so this is a really good quick one... ...you can probably prepare it in about 15 minutes... ...first thing to do is to boil the kettle... ...second thing to do is to pour some rice into a pan... ...the nice thing about rice is that we'll probably eat it on a different day... ...if you cook too much and it's really cheap. So maybe like a mug and a half of rice... ...or if you insist on measuring it, or you can just plate it by... ...into a pan... ...don't put a specific amount of water into it... ...just like pour some water over it... ...so that they're covered and there's a bit more water... ...and set a timer for 12 minutes, so the point of this... ...how we're doing the rice today is that we are sticking to that timer... ...we're going to make sure that about 10 minutes we're tasting the rice... ...so you should be able to taste whether or not the rice is too crunchy or not. If it's too crunchy, it needs a bit more time. If it's at 10 minutes and it's dry, it needs some more water. If it gets to 12 minutes and it's too crunchy, it needs some more water. Not a lot of water, just a little bit of more water. Anyway, eventually, probably some time around 12-13 minutes... ...you'll have evaporated all the water and you will also have some rice, so that'll be nice. The curry takes not very long at all, so for 2.5 people... ...I think we need 3 tons of curry. These can be of the same type, these can be different types. This can be the only things we have available. Try and make a combination that seems to make sense to you and be really to defend it. But yeah, they seem to have... ...there is in fact a card on Trello with the different tastes of all the different currys. But they seem to have a fair amount of variation in how spicy they are, so your mileage may vary. Next recipe. Actually, I have some ingredients for this written down. So, 10 minutes are different, I always prepare this dish. No, just do yours. Okay, so I... ...great Michael Jets into a... ...tubbered pot, tubbered pot, even put the lid on, ...semi goes it and serves in the microwave for 3 minutes. I mean, I can then get rid of some of the water which will have come out of cooking it. I need to do some spinach, so that could be done in the microwave in a single pot, really, so it's a pot. I mean, this is a time... ...combine the de-fossil spinach with ricotta, at least one tub or a lute, and at least one pack of... ...feta or fake feta, that's all grumbled up. First things first, I think I forgot to say it at the beginning. You need to make some tomato sauce. I find that they're not very... ...they're not stupidly cheap tomatoes. It's the best for this, because you get a bit of sauce with them. But basically, you want to reduce the water quality in your tomatoes anyway. ...a couple of... ...a couple of tins of tomatoes into a pan, and stick them on a low heat to boil away for... ...a half an hour, 4 minutes, something like that. Season that taste. So I like how to boil... ...a tiny bit of tomato sauce, and a bit of salt and pepper. Then layer up the oil in the lamp, yeah, basically. So you've got, and then sort of... ...your codet mixture can be like your pasta, and your... ...the ricotta and spinach mixture is like your fillet. So, let me let you let me finish with some of the sauce... ...and then some grated cheese on the top. And that goes in the oven for... ...about 30-40 minutes, and I'm delighted. Should have been a nice and... ...delicious and bubbly. It will tolerate cooking for longer. I like what we dangerous if it's cooked a bit less. It's quite a big investment, actually. There have been all sorts of variations produced over the last couple of years with... ...difference, ice next to the oven, and different cheeses, again quite a big investment... ...can tolerate stuff. Let's talk about one of the most complex recipes... ...bapetators. So... I don't really get why people call things that you eat with... ...but they're baked potatoes, toppings, because... ...they don't just go on them, they sometimes go on to them. But some favourites around here include... ...tuna, cheese, grated cheese, ...coated cheese, baked beans. Chop tomatoes. Maybe a sweet one. Yeah. In terms of how much to cook, I would say... ...that if you budgeted two potatoes for a team... ...one-and-a-half potatoes for a gen... ...and one potato for a gen. Then... ...you'd probably be doing all right. And if you added a spare one... ...just for the pot... ...then you'd probably be doing well. You can do them in the microwave for... ...some amount of time, as long as you don't... ...do them for too long. Start with five-minute bursts... ...and then you can turn them over and stick them... ...while... ...but you're not start. You're small potato for 15 minutes. Well, I think so. Rub them in kitchen rolls... ...so that the moisture stays close to them... ...and they're super heated and trying to burn your fingers. If you're not sure when the person... ...if you don't need them instantly... ...and you're not sure when the person... ...he's kind of coming home is going to arrive... ...you can do them half in the microwave... ...and then put them in the oven at say 180... ...and leave them there almost indefinitely... ...or certainly for like 45 minutes of uncertainty time... ...and it's quite forgiving like that. So if you have a meal where you're not sure... ...when someone's coming home or when that meal needs to be... ...this is a really good one to kind of allow that... ...there to be some flexibility there. And provider already, wholesome meal... ...which everyone will enjoy. Jen, would you like to do cauliflower cheese? Since I keep fucking it up. Okay, cauliflower cheese. You need two constituent parts, some cauliflower and some cheese sauce. So cauliflower, you... ...well, I watch my vegetables too, which is usually that less often. Yes, wash your vegetables. And then pull a part or chop into fairly evenly-sized florets... ...which you're about a bit bigger than the baby's hand... ...and then... ...and then... ...on all those for... ...lif they're quite big. Maybe five or six minutes if they're fairly small and so four or five... ...poke them with a knife check that they're soft enough... ...you don't want them completely falling apart because that'll just be sad. And while that's happening, you make some cheese sauce. So... ...about a pint of milk, get a pan... ...and... ...a couple of heat tables, things of... ...playing flour, again, being free in this house... ...and beat that in. You whisk that in while they're more... ...and the batter's the same quantity of butter... ...and keep whisking while that melts in. And then the sauce will thicken up over the next minute or two. Once it's nice and thick, give it another minute or two... ...to cook through. At salt and pepper and a shitload of grated cheese... ...taste it check it's okay. Once you're... ...colour-fat is cooked... ...drain it really well, let it dry out... ...and then pour it into... ...an oven-proof dish or some description. On the parakex season, all of the pork ones... ...pots also at the top. Add a bit more grated cheese... ...and then shove it in the oven at 180°C for... ...15 to 30 minutes until the cheese is melted... ...and the edges are ready. And then set. I tend to not add all of the stalk and all of the leaves... ...but it's all part of the plant. So the leaves will definitely take longer to cook than the plants... ...because they are fairly tough. But yeah, they can certainly be included in this part of it. Super. So when it comes to meals... ...like pizza... ...this is another... ...gay to friendly classic. Jen needs pizzas from Azda... ...which are gluten-free... ...and can be procured as a good price. She likes to have with her pizza. I very, so... ...you've had them recently. I've had them with... ...doch cheese and honey with spinach and an egg... ...with ham and mushroom... ...yeah, so... ...I tend to add to my pizza... ...if it depends on what's in the fridge, basically. Smashing. I... ...tim largely likes his pizzas with... ...lot extra cheese... ...if we have any extra onions... ...he will have a small onion or a half an onion... ...jopped up on the pizza... ...probably... ...on top of the cheese or something. ...Tim might also like a sliced tomato on top of his pizza. Tim probably prefers... ...a... ...like two non-breds from Tesco rather than a pizza. Yeah, that's probably... ...that Tim doesn't need tomato paste on his non-breds. You can eat them neat. So, Thai curry. So, number one thing with Thai curry... ...is that there's a lot of chopping to do and stuff. So, trying to schedule some prep time in before... ...and actually you can get it on the hob and sort of boil it... ...and let it steep and stuff... ...and it just improves up to a point. So, the way to reduce the cooking time is to microwave... ...most of the veg before you show it in... ...because then you just need to let go of it... ...and then we're really faster. So, first of all, you're going to need some butter and that squash probes. One of the ways that you can acquire some butter and that squash... ...is frozen butter and that squash. Alternatively, you can roast the butter and that squash for... ...you can chop a butter and that squash into chunks. And... ...and drop them in some... ...in some oil in a baking tray for about 40 minutes. And... ...if they kind of like to squish in, you can easily slide a knife through them... ...they're sort of the brilliant banging. So... ...you're going to need a... ...tikari pouch. You're going to need two tins of coconut milk. You're going to need some rice. You're probably going to want some... ...water chestnut slices, some cashews, some spinach. This can be fresh or frozen. You could have some broccoli. You could have some onion. You could have a little bit of mushroom if you'd like. Basically, most veg that you've got knocking around... ...especially the stuff that looks like it should have been thrown away several days ago. You can probably whack it in. But moderation is probably a key because... ...you're going to be making quite a lot of food already. And the wok we have is not that big. Yeah. It's just a problem that comes very... ...it becomes a problem fairly quickly when you can't stand it. So... ...with Thai curry... ...you want to drop the paste... ...some of the paste into the wok with a bit of oil... ...just fry it a little bit... ...and then pour some of the... ...thingy milk in coconut milk into the wok... ...and drop any of the stuff that you have that you think will take the longest... ...to cook into the thing. So this might be some stems of some broccoli. This might be some carrot bits. This might be... ...whatever you have that you think is probably like the toughest... ...biggest, baddest, horrible, nastiest thing. Just drop that in first. As we're just going to just... ...oh gee, next. So drop those in. Cook them a little bit. And then... ...you can probably just start loving... ...other shit into the thing. So you can drop in the button at squash. That probably won't be the longest thing. You can drop in the spinach. It won't really mind being kind of bold too much. It'll just sort of disintegrate. You can drop in any broccoli you have. You can drop in... ...basically anything you want. To be honest, if you want to drop in the... ...you probably do a little bit better to just leave it... ...bubbling away for a little bit now. You can pour in some more... ...another half of your coconut milk. And if you've got any extra coconut magic... ...and now... ...and probably around about now... ...you're going to want to get your rice on. So you're rice is going to take 12 minutes. You're going to boil a kettle. You're going to put the rice in the pan. I recommend you about a mug and a half full. But you can improvise to whatever mechanism you like. And a mug and a half full of rice with a... ...water covering it. And boiling a bit. That's going to kind of cook nicely. You want to set a timer for that for 12 minutes though. And if you're coming up towards like 10 minutes... ...and the water's no longer covering the rice... ...give it a taste. If it's feeling a bit crunchy, pour some more water over it... ...so it comes to the top. If it comes up to 12 minutes, give it a rise to taste. If it's feeling a bit crunchy, pour some more water over the top. If it comes up to 13 minutes... ...you're like, shit. Still taste a bit crunchy. Boil some more water over it, bubble it a bit more. It comes up to 14 minutes and it tastes good. Take it off the heat. And save it up with everything else. Going back to the Thai curry. You're going to want to drop in in the last like five minutes. One or two handfuls of cashews, all of the... ...all of the... ...and any other last minute ingredients that you can think of to drop in. That's it. So this you'll need to get the gluten free soy sauce and the normal soy sauce. And Jen might enjoy the plum. Shah would just sauce thing. And I think that's it. Jen. I think we have had it with... ...for one breakfast once or twice a bit. Would you like to explain far heaters? Yes. So... ...what you're going to need is some betters. I think we need about eight or nine to a plus or small. If we hungry. Some honey, some cheese, some sour cream, some chicken. That's why you're really... Okay, so you chop your peppers into strips. And run them in the oven with some oil and some very spice which. For about two hundred for about thirty-five to forty minutes. Check on the result of the... ...to the not completely annihilated. And while that's cooking, you get some of the rest of the stuff. So chicken, and chicken thighs taken out. Sorry, a defrosted chicken thigh takes about twenty minutes to cook at 180. So if the oven's not 200, it's going to be about 17 or 18 minutes. They can go in a pyrex casserole lid or some sort of cake tin. Or a baking sheet, that's actually funny. The loo meat can either go in the side and then either put in the oven for about fifteen minutes. Or fried in a big frying pan with a bit of oil for about five to six minutes. It may again be easier to place it in the kitchen. And just because again, this is a lot of pans and... ...pans and things. Yeah, just so that you're three hot things. So you're peppers, you're the chicken and the loo meat. To dish up your meat, sour cream, cheese, and a greater... ...of course, the most awesome things. Yeah, that's perfect. Cool, so... ...beat treat risotto. Please, if you... Okay, so... ...for beetroot risotto, you need risotto rice. I think when we... ...I think we have about 300 grams... ...between the two of us... ...and this morning, having some... ...which is just over half a box. You also need some... ...or maybe using cooked beetroot for a while now, so that... ...a formative packs. So it's just do small packs. So we tend to use do. I'll dig in much bigger pack, so you'll meet one of those. So if you're using an onion, you chop your onion into small pieces... ...and fry that in some... ...as all amount of oil with some more amount of butter... ...until it's translucent, which will take... ...for... ...eight to ten minutes. Once you've hit translucent, throw in all your rice... ...give it a good stir, get it covered in the oil... ...and put the fats in the pan. Once that is nice and hot... ...if you can chuck in a glass of... ...as whole glass of white wine. If there isn't... ...it doesn't matter, don't worry about it. Add... ...half a cup of boiling water... ...and a stock pot. A stock pot thing, the vegetables got a pot. That will melt over time, but it can need to be... ...someone is a bit of a currant in this intuition. And... ...can you don't want it melted to the bottom of the pan. Stir it with it very well. And add more water. As you go along, not too much at any time. The whole thing will take about... ...15 to 18 minutes to cook. Once you've started adding water, otherwise. First of all, I'll be true. I'll add about 10 minutes. Grated well... ...and all the juice that come in the bucket. And then I'll add 10 to cook in the other bucket. As you come in towards the end of the cooking time... ...you want your rice to be pretty soft... ...but not completely mushy. And it needs to be stirred all the way through... ...because otherwise it will stick. Add salt and pepper. And then serve that with sour cream... ...to go to cheese. And... ...dames the mushy from... ...don't give them glitch to you to start with a hint just the other. Making hits and risotto for this. Yes, it will stay in your hand... ...but it's only warm up with you for long. Marvellous. It's delicious, isn't it? I'll do you veggie chilli. Veggie chilli, by 10 minutes recipe. So first of all, you're going to need a fuck ton of food. Get yourself some... ...and be prepared to make a fuck ton of food. Make sure that you've got some celery. A rugby team of hungry people to feed. One large red bell pepper, two medium sized carrots. A lot of paprika, a lot of ground cumin. Basically those two spices you can't kind of overdo. I see it really mean that... ...the recipe must here massively under does it. So you kind of need like... ...three tablespoons of each to be honest. Maybe two tablespoons of ground cumin and two tablespoons of paprika. You're going to need a teaspoon of dried oregano. You're going to need two tins of chopped tomatoes. And three tins of some sort of different pulses things. Black beans, red beans, yellow beans, beans, beans in water, beans in chilli sauce. I mean I recommend going into the shop and having a look at what's cheap and what's nice. And if you're an elder then it's probably everything. So anyway, get one of each different beans. Don't get three cans of the same things because you're not super boring. You're also going to need a bay leaf. It probably helps to have like some avocado or some tortilla chips and some cheese or some sour cream or some grated cheddar cheese. Ready to go with this thing, but you could also garnish it with rice or jacket potatoes. So like many of these, this is a dish that all of the work is in the prep and then the cooking can take as long or largely as short as you want. So find one of our biggest pans, put some oil in the bottom, chopped onion, a chopped bell pepper and chopped carrot. All the chopped celery and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and stir and combine it basically for like ten to seven minutes, seven to ten minutes. Just keep stirring it and make the veg nice and kind of like sauteed. Then add some garlic, some chilli powder, now with chilli powder you probably don't want to add that much like. This isn't our meal that is improved actually by chilli, it's probably weakened by chilli so. And we particularly careful with more spicy versions of chilli. I'd recommend like a teaspoon of chilli and then like two tablespoons of smoked paprika or paprika on a bit of oregano and two tablespoons of cumin. You can't overdo it on the cumin honestly. You'll just make it, it says like cook it for about a minute and that's probably a great idea. Now with the chopped tomatoes and the beans, you can probably just don't bother draining any of them, just empty all of them into the pot. Because this is probably like an effective way of doing it. So if the like the beans come in water, just like bang that all in fishbush. And let it kind of come to a simmer if you want. You could add some a stock pot at this point to kind of extra add to the flavor and staunch of it all. This would be the right moment to do that. So keep cooking it, keep stirring it, don't let it stick to the bottom. Cook it probably for about 30 minutes or until you feel it's done. This could be longer than 30 minutes. That's not a problem, just don't let it stick to the bottom. So if you need to lower the heat, then that's fine. Honestly, if you needed to kind of like leave this now for a couple of hours before you eat it, that would be fine. Take it off from the chili, from the heat, sorry, and ideally use like a stick blender to blend some proportion of it. Now you might like it blended seep a fine or you might like it blended more thick blended to whatever you think is the right blendedness, which may or may not be. Make soup can seek consistency or crunchy consistency, it doesn't really matter. Give it a stir, give it a taste, you might want to choose to add a little bit of vinegar or a bit of salt and serve it up, this will keep for some time and yeah it's really kind of filling easy dish that can feed large groups quite easily. Jan, have you got any recipes you'd like to add? What was the recipe you just did today? Empty ladders. We'd like to feel that. Okay yeah, we'll give you that. Right, so it's not how we'd empty ladders, you need something for the filling, so today I did. Three peppers that I chopped into short strips and fried with some oil and a bit of a little bit of a heat to spice. You need a, I also added some leather rice and a tin of sweet corn. You need a, and to add a kit, a gluten-free and to add a kit. I think there's one here from Aldi, which contains a pack of gluten-free to taste and two sorts of sauce. I mixed it with filling, with a bit of the cooking sauce from the packet. And then, milk to mine and Jananas, where it's so you take the tortilla. You, they all have to put all the tortillas into the microwave just to make sure they're nice and soft. Then you take the tortilla, you put some of the filling in it. It's going to be a little bit of cheese on and then pop it in the dish. So I used the big, big, big, big, big, oblong pyrarchs that we've got. And it ensures we'll go inside my side, quite neatly. There was a little bit of extra filling there, so I popped that. One end of all of the, all of the, my little Phil's tortillas. The packet contains a creamy topping sauce. It's like, well, just all over the top. And then a shed load of grated cheddar, got shredded on top of that. I baked it at 180 for about 15 minutes. And it was better tasty. We had it with tortilla chips. The night, it could be quite nice with salad. Two might and things up a little bit. Or if you wish to start up further, it could be done with chips or wedges. Do you want to tell us how you make pielets? Ah, pielets are a snack to that James likes lots, and I like to use a breakfast before we're going to let. And so these are called pielets, like pielets, little pies. Yeah, pielet, only done to eat. Um, rather than... pielets, like, and so many, five things. So, take two, like, bananas, mash them well. Um, add a mug of, doing three oats. Obviously, two are both with the bananas. And two eggs. Um, and some sort of liquid. I've done them with kombucha, and I've had some bread with milk, with water, with fruit juice. And they'll kind of taste the same in the end. So add some sort of wet. I've, I've, I've done several variations on themes, so I've done. Um, sorry. Start now. So you mix, mix your ingredients together with whatever liquid you're using, and then leave it for about an hour. So that the oats absorb the liquid, and then you can add whatever other ingredients you're using. And pour them, pour them next to them into this liquean bun, tombs, and bake them. And then add about 180 for about 30 to 35 minutes, depending on how well they're built. Um, so, recipe variations I have done. Um, I have done, kind of, carrot cake, one, and so on, it's grated carrot. Um, wheat, your get, um, cinnamon. Um, they came back quite nicely, but they needed a bit longer to cook, because they were quite soggy. Um, you can add, I've added peanut butter as protein sauce. Just into the mix, and then do those ones with either raspberries or blueberries. You can use frozen ones, but they can make a little bit soggy, so I would tend to defrost the fruit that you're using. Um, the mix. Um, and again, they hold together better if you put a bit of butter in the, um, in the, um, in the lunting, then put the fruit on them, but more butter was up. Um, pardon me. Um, another variation I've done is adding, other fruit I've added, but not, so I added apples. I've added pears. Grated up, I've added, I've done, um, blueberries or blueberries, or raspberries, as the fruit, in, in, sort of, whole in them, in them. Um, and I've done some with the butter and the layers of either cashew or almond butter, and then more that wrong type. Um, they tend to create a bit less time to cook, because they're a bit smaller than more of the fruit in. Um, let them cool completely in the tin, in the, in the, in the, and bun tin, before trying to get them out, because if you try and get them out, then they'll sort of part. Um, and then stick them in a tubware and in the fridge, and they'll keep for five, five, six days, if they're not all being eaten by them. They're really easy. And James likes helping the mix. Can I do a rest of your breakfast work breakfast? Um, so my standard work breakfast is... some Greek yogurt in a tapware pot with a... dessert spoon of peanut butter and a small squeeze of honey. Um, with some fruit added to it, so which is very often blue, which goes away like them. Um, and then vanilla, then... It's almost, I think it's almost a, it's almost a summer portion. It's sprinkling of vanilla added, like, as the last thing before I leave for work, so it's still, it's still crunchy. I don't want to eat it, so that's what I tend to have. Do you think you're any more recipes to add?
