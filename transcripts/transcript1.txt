we can probably hear you quite well. So that's quite neat. So today we're playing Write Some Recipes. So they're nice and written down. So what I suggest that we do here, I've got the Meals That Work card up here. If one of us, it could be you, but it probably is different others for different recipes, can go through these recipes. And I guess if you're talking about the recipe, it'd probably help if you looked over your shoulder. Spoke this way rather than your phone. And try to describe the recipe just as sort of effectively as possible. So I'll go first because then it'll make, I'll sort of demo what to do. What's a very Tim recipe here? So, in, when we make burgers, we, the first thing to start doing is to chop potatoes into make some wedges. So we need to do that first, a very important first thing. We need to chop them into chips, like three, three, chop them into quarters. Skin on four. Fries. Don't have to be that big. If we got sweet potatoes, chop some of them in as well. Jen fucking loves sweet potatoes. So that's pretty good. So does James. And James. So there we go. And then get them in the oven at like 180C and they need 40 minutes. Now you've got time to gather and sort out all the shit for the other ingredients. Um, but they tend to need to be on in the next 20 minutes. So you got to work rapid isomo to make that happen. So the other ingredients that you need to search out are, halloumi, mushrooms, chicken. Burgers. So all of these items probably take about 20 minutes. This is assuming that the chicken is thawed. Yeah. Yeah. ain't thawed you better be unthawing it fasto bro um so thought or it can get from frozen in half in about half an hour or you can cook it from frozen in about half an hour so the beyond meat burgers are gluten free so they technically could be on the same tray as the mushrooms the mushrooms and the beyond meat burgers probably want to be in the oven for 20 minutes um the chicken also probably wants to be in the oven at about 180 for 20 minutes um you can just put them on baking trays and put them in the oven maybe sprinkle a little bit of oil over the mushrooms and you'll probably have wanted to sprinkle a bit of oil over the potato wedges too um when it comes to the halimi probably the best easiest way of doing it i found is to put it in the big frying pan and fry it for about six minutes but you probably want to start at minus 10 minutes or 10 t minus 10 minutes because something will will not quite work right things we need on the table are mayo aioli um chili mayo bread rolls for tim gluten-free bread rolls for jen water plates teaspoons big spoons salt and pepper if they're raw tomatoes tim would like a raw tomato if there's blue creme generally yeah if there's blood creme spread thing then would like that could also be worth bringing a block of cheese and a cheese grater especially if we're missing one of the key ingredients it also can be easier to plate up in the kitchen so leaving all the plates in the kitchen and then bringing the things onto the top of the cooker it's probably easier with the number of trays that might well exist at this point james will eat basically everything especially halimi hi do you want to do um right then um i suppose a bit complicated one um and does take a while so first things first you need to grate your courgettes into a pan and stick them on a sort of medium-ish heat for maybe 10 minutes and then stick in some frozen spinach you're going to end up with a total weight of about 500 grams but basically you cook it until most of the water's disappeared because otherwise it gets really sloppy so that's probably going to take the best part of an hour in total next part of the process is to boil some pasta because we're making it gen friendly we always use a group free one so whatever the instructions are the packet plus about two minutes. The recipe calls for 100 grams, we've never done it with that little, ever. Next step is to make a very thick white sauce, so 50 grams of plain flour, 50 grams of butter and 300 ml of milk in a pan and whisk until, the way I do it is to put the milk in the pan, put the flour in the pan, whisk until it's combined, then put the heat on and put the butter in and just keep whisking until it thickens up, which it will do shortly after the butter has melted. Cook that for a couple of minutes once it gets really, really thick. Then take it off the heat and add the spinach mixture and a load of grated cheese. Again, the recipe calls for 150 grams, but we use probably twice that at least to make it nice and cheesy. And then comes the thumb bit with the eggs, so you need to separate... The recipe calls for three separated eggs plus an extra white. So the egg yolks go in the spinach and sauce mixture and the egg whites go in a bowl separately to be whisked once they're at least soft peaks, so once you can lift the bowl over your head and it doesn't fall out of the bowl. Yeah, fold them into the sauce mixture carefully, gently. And then the easiest way I've found to then dish, sort of put this into dishes is to pour a bit of the mixture into some of the Pyrex round casseroles, then put some pasta in and sort of amalgamate that, then pour more mixture over the top of that. It bakes at 180 for something like 35 minutes. And they'll be really fecking hot, so it takes a bit of time to cool down. Yeah, it's a nice recipe, but it does take a while. So that's the flavor. So I'll just do our... Our tinned curry recipe, so this is a really good quick one. You can probably prepare it in about 15 minutes. First thing to do is to boil the kettle. Second thing to do is to pour some rice into a pan. The nice thing about rice is that we'll probably eat it on a different day if you cook too much and it's really cheap. So maybe like a mug of rice and a half of rice, or if you insist on measuring it, or you can just plate it by ear into a pan. Don't put a specific amount of water into it. Just, like, pour some water over it so that they're covered and there's a bit more water. And set a timer for 12 minutes. So the point of this, the way we're doing the rice today is that... ... we are sticking to that timer. We're going to make sure that at about 10 minutes we're tasting the rice. So you should be able to taste whether or not the rice is too crunchy or not. If it's too crunchy, it needs a bit more time. If it's at 10 minutes and it's dry, it needs some more water. If it gets to 12 minutes and it's too crunchy, it needs some more water. Not a lot of water, just a little bit more water. Anyway, eventually, probably sometime around 12, 13 minutes, you'll have evaporated all the water and you will also have some rice. So that'll be nice. The curry takes not very long at all. So for 2.5 people, I think we need 3 tins of curry. These can be of the same type. These can be different types. This can be the only things we have available. Try and make up a combination that seems to make sense to you and be ready to defend it furiously. But yeah, they all seem to have... There is in fact a card on Trello with the different tastes of all the different curries, but they all seem to have a fair amount of variation in how spicy they are. So your mileage may vary. Next recipe! Some... ...flinted lasagne? We actually have some ingredients for this written down. Cool. So, Tim and I differ in our ways of preparing this dish. No, just do yours. Just do mine. Okay, so I grate my courgettes into a Tupperware pod, Tupperware pot even. Put the lid on. Semi-close it and shove it in the microwave for 3 minutes. Meaning I can then get rid of some of the water which will have come out of cooking it. I need to defrost some spinach, so that again could be done in the microwave in a seal pot. Or in a semi-seal pot. Sort of a minute at a time. Combine the defrosted spinach with ricotta. At least one tub, probably two. And at least one pack of feta, or fake feta, that's all crumbled up. Ah, first things first, the thing I forgot to say at the beginning. You need to make some tomato sauce. Erm... I find that the not very, the not stupidly cheap tomatoes work best for this. Because you get a richer sauce with them. Erm... But basically you want to reduce the water quantity in your tomatoes anyway. So, erm... Open a couple of tins of tomatoes into a pan. Erm... And stick them on a low heat to boil away for... For half an hour or forty minutes. Something like that. Erm... Season that to taste. Erm... That's why I like adding garlic oil, Italian spices, dried spice... Sorry, Italian herbs. Erm... And a bit of salt and pepper. Erm... Then layer up your lasagne, basically. So, you've got... And then a sort of... Your courgette mixture can be like your pasta. Erm... And your... The ricotta and spinach mixture is then like your filling. So... Layer, layer, layer. Finish with some tomato sauce and then some grated cheese on the top. Erm... And that goes in the oven for about... 35 to 40 minutes at 180. Should they be all nice and, erm... Delicious and bubbly. Erm... It will tolerate cooking for longer. Erm... And it won't be dangerous if it's cooked for a bit less. Erm... It's quite a forgiving recipe in that respect. Erm... There have been all sorts of variations produced over the last couple of years with different spice mixtures in and different cheeses. Again, quite a forgiving recipe. Can tolerate stuff like that. Let's talk about one of the most complex recipes. Baked potatoes. So... I don't really get why people call things that you eat with baked potatoes, toppings. Because they don't just go on them, they sometimes go under them. Erm... But some favourites around here include... Tuna. Cheese. Grated cheese. Cottage cheese. Baked beans. Chopped tomatoes. Chopped tomatoes, yeah. Maybe sweetcorn? Yeah. I don't know what sweetcorn is. Erm... In terms of how much to cook, I would say that if you budgeted two potatoes for Tim, one and a half potatoes for Jen, and one potato for James, then... you'd probably be doing alright. And if you added a spare one just for the pot, then you'd probably be doing well. Erm... You can do them in the microwave for some amount of time, so long as you don't do them for too long. Start with five minute bursts, and then you can turn them over, check them, and then stick them back on for five minutes. Whilst... Do not start your small potato for fifteen minutes, or bad things will happen. Wrap them in kitchen rolls so that the moisture kind of stays close to them and they're superheated, and try not to burn your fingers. If you're not sure when the person... If you don't need them instantly, and you're not sure when the person who's kind of coming home is going to arrive, you can do them half in the microwave and then put them in the oven at, say, 180. Erm... And leave them there almost indefinitely, or certainly for like 45 minutes of uncertainty time. Erm... And it's quite forgiving like that. So if you... You have a meal where you're not sure when someone's coming home or when that meal needs to be, this is a really good one to kind of allow that... There to be some flexibility there. Erm... And provide a really wholesome meal which everyone will enjoy. Cool. Jen, would you like to do cauliflower cheese? Since I keep fucking it up. OK, cauliflower cheese. You need two constituent parts, some cauliflower and some cheese sauce. Erm... So, cauliflower, you... Well, I watered it. I wash my vegetables. Tim seems to do that less often. Erm... Yes, wash your vegetables and then pull apart or chop into fairly evenly sized florets, erm... Which are about a bit bigger than the baby's hand, basically. Erm... Erm... And then boil those for... Well, if they're quite big, maybe five minutes. Maybe five or six minutes. If they're fairly small, then say four or five. Erm... Poke them with a knife. Check that they're soft enough. You don't want them completely falling apart because that'll just be sad. Erm... And while that's happening, you make some cheese sauce. So... Erm... About a pint of milk in a pan. Add a couple of heaped tablespoons of plain flour. And then... Again, gluten free in this house. And beat that in. Whisk that in rather more. Add about the same quantity of butter. And keep whisking while that melts in and then the sauce will thicken up over the next minute or two. Erm... Once it's nice and thick, give it another minute or two to cook through. Erm... Add salt and pepper and a shitload of grated cheese. Erm... taste it, check it's okay. Once your cauliflower is cooked, drain it really well, let it dry out and then pour it into an ovenproof dish or something of description, one of the Pyrexes or one of the croc ones. Pour the sauce over the top, add a bit more grated cheese and then shove it in the oven at 180 for 15-20 minutes until the cheese has melted and the edges are bubbly and then serve. I tend not to add all of the stalk and all of the leaves but it's all part of the plan so the leaves will definitely take longer to cook. be included as part of it. So when it comes to meals like PIZZA. When it comes to meals like pizza this is another go-to friendly classic. Jen needs pizzas from Asda which are gluten-free and can be procured at a good price. She likes to have with her pizza. I vary, so I've had them recently with just a load of cheese. I've had them with goat's cheese and honey, with spinach and an egg, with ham and mushroom. Yeah, so I tend to add stuff to my pizza, but it depends on what's in the fridge, basically. Smashing. Tim largely likes his pizzas with extra cheese. If we have any extra onions, he will have a small onion or a half an onion chopped up on the pizza, probably on top of the cheese or something. Tim might also like a sliced tomato. Tim probably prefers two naan breads from Tesco rather than a pizza. Yeah, that's probably... Tim doesn't need tomato paste on his naan breads. You can eat them neat. So, Thai curry. So, number one thing with Thai curry is that there's a lot of chopping to do and stuff, so try and schedule some prep time in before it. And actually, you can get it on the hob and sort of boil it and let it steep and stuff, and it just improves up to a point. Another way to reduce the cooking time is to... Microwave most of the veg before you shove it in, because then you essentially just heat it all up together and then it will be really flustered. So, first of all, you're going to need some butternut squash probs. One of the ways that you can acquire some butternut squash is with frozen butternut squash. Alternatively, you can roast the butternut squash for... You can chop a butternut squash into chunks. Small chunks. And drop them in some oil in a baking tray for about 40 minutes. And if they're kind of like squishy and you can easily slide a knife through them, they're a bomber. They're sorted. They're brilliant. Bang in. So, you're going to need a Thai curry pouch. You're going to need two tins of coconut milk. You're going to need some rice. You're probably going to want some water chestnut slices. Some cashews. Some spinach. This can be fresh or frozen. You could have some broccoli. You could have some onion. You could have a little bit of mushroom if you'd like. Basically, most veg that you've got knocking isining. around especially the stuff that looks like it should have dead been thrown away several days ago you can probably whack it in but moderation is probably a key because you're going to be making quite a lot of food already and the wok we have is not that big which is the problem that comes fairly quickly when you can't stir anything so with Thai curry you want to drop the paste some of the paste into the wok with a bit of oil and just fry it up a little bit and then pour some of the thingy milk in coconut milk into the wok and drop any of the stuff that you have that you think will take the longest to cook into the thing so this might be some stems of some broccoli this might be some carrot bits this might be whatever you have that you think is probably like the toughest roughest biggest baddest horriblest nastiest thing just drop that in first as we discovered yesterday omg it takes ages to cook so drop those in cook them a little bit and then you can probably just start lobbing other shit into the thing so you can drop in the butternut squash that probably won't be the longest thing you can drop in the spinach again it it won't really mind being kind of boiled too much it'll just sort of disintegrate you can drop in any any broccoli you have you can drop in basically anything you want to be honest if you want to drop in the you probably do a little bit better to just leave it bubbling away for a little bit now you can pour in some more another half of your coconut milk and if you've got any extra coconut milk use coconut milk. extra coconut magic, you could drop this in now. And probably around about now you're going to want to get your rice on. So your rice is going to take 12 minutes, you're going to boil a kettle, you're going to put the rice in the pan, I recommend about a mug and a half full, but you can improvise to whatever mechanism you like, and a mug and a half full of rice with a water covering it and boiling a bit, that's going to kind of cook nicely. You want to set a timer for that for 12 minutes though. And if you're coming up towards like 10 minutes and the water's no longer covering the rice, give it a taste. If it's feeling a bit crunchy, pour some more water in. If it comes up to 12 minutes, give the rice a taste, if it's feeling a bit crunchy, pour some more water over the top. If it comes up to 13 minutes and you're like, shit, it still tastes a bit crunchy, pour some more water over it, bubble it a bit more. If it comes up to 14 minutes and it tastes good, take it off the heat and serve it up with everything else. Going back to the Thai curry, you're going to want to drop in in the last like 5 minutes, one or two handfuls of cashews, all of the water chestnuts, and any other last minute ingredients that you can think of to drop in. And that's it, you'll need to get the gluten-free soy sauce and the normal soy sauce, and Jen might enjoy the... ...sour plum, charwood sauce thing. And I think that's it. Jen? I think we have had it with prawn crackers once or twice, but they are not a requirement. Would you like to explain fajitas? Yes, so, what you're going to need is some feathers. Yes. I think we need about eight or nine for the two of us, plus the small, if we're hungry. Some halloumi, some cheese, some sour cream, some chicken, that's about it really. Okay, so you chop your peppers into strips and bun them in the oven with some oil and some fajita spice, which we have in a big jar, at about 200 for about 35 to 40 minutes. Check on them every so often though, so they're not completely annihilated. Okay. Okay. And while that's cooking, you get on with the rest of the stuff. So chicken thighs take about, sorry, a defrosted chicken thigh takes about 20 minutes to cook at 180, so if the oven's on at 200, it's going to be about 17 or 18 minutes. They can go in a Pyrex. Pyrex casserole lid, or some sort of cake tin, or on a baking sheet, that's absolutely fine. Halloumi can either go, can be sliced and then either put in the oven for about 15 minutes, or be fried in a big frying pan with a bit of oil for about five or six minutes. It may also, I don't know, be cooked in the oven for about 15 or 20 minutes, but that's it. It may again be easier to plate up in the kitchen, just because again, just because there are a lot of pans and pans and things, yeah, to serve up. So you've got your three hot things, so your peppers, your, the chicken and the halloumi. To dish up, you'll need sour cream, cheese, and a grater, obviously, a nice box, but you'll need a bit of that as well. And, yeah. That's about it I think. Cool. So, beetroot risotto. Do you want me to do that one? Please, if you... Okay. So. So for beetroot risotto you need risotto rice, I think we have about 300 grams between the two of us and the small having some, which is just over half a box. You also need some, well we've been using cooked beetroot for a while now so they're vacuum formed packs, so we do small packs so we tend to use two, Aldi do a much bigger pack so you only need one of those. So if you're using an onion you chop your onion into small pieces and fry that in some, a small amount of oil with a small amount of butter until it's translucent which will take eight to ten minutes. Once you've hit translucent throw in all your rice give it a good stir, get it covered in the oil that's in the, the fat that's in the pan. Once that is nice and hot you can chuck in a glass of, a small glass of white wine if there is some kicking about, if there isn't it doesn't matter don't worry about it. Add half a cup of boiling water and a stock pot, stock pot thing, a vegetable stock pot, that will melt over time but it will need, it will need a bit of encouragement with disintuitive because you didn't want it melted to the bottom of the pan. Stir everything very well and add more water as you go along. not too much at any one time. The whole thing will take about 15-18 minutes to cook once you've started adding water to the rice. First lot of beetroot I tend to put in at about 10 minutes, grated well, and all the juice that comes in the packet. Then I would tend to put in the other packet as you're coming towards the end of the cooking time. You want your rice to be pretty soft, but not completely mushy. It needs to be stir-fried quite a bit and stirred all the way through because otherwise it will stick. Add salt and pepper, and then serve that with sour cream and goat's cheese. James is a massive fan. Don't give him goat's cheese to start with or he'll just eat that. Make him eat some risotto first. Yes, it will stain your hand, but the staining will not be for long. Marvellous. That's most of the stuff on the lid. I'll do veggie chilli. Okay. Veggie chilli by Tim's recipe. First of all, you're going to need a fuck-ton of food. Get yourself some... And be prepared to make a fuck-ton of food. Make sure that you've got some celery, a rugby team of hungry people to feed. One large red bell pepper, two medium sized carrots, a lot of paprika, a lot of ground cumin. Basically those two spices you can't kind of overdo. I seriously mean that. The recipe here massively underdoes it so you kind of need like three tablespoons of each to be honest. Maybe two tablespoons of ground cumin and two tablespoons of paprika. You're going to need a teaspoon of dried oregano, you're going to need two tins of chopped tomatoes and three tins of some sort of garlic. You're going to need a teaspoon of dried oregano, you're going to need two different pulses things. So like black beans, red beans, yellow beans, beans in water, beans in chilli sauce. Yeah I mean I recommend going into the shop and having a look at what's cheap and what's nice and if you're an Aldi then it's probably everything. So anyway get one of one of each different bean. Don't get three cans of the same things because you're not super boring. You're also going to need a bay leaf and it probably helps to have like some avocado or some tortilla chips and some cheese or some sour cream or some grated cheddar cheese ready to go with this thing. But you could also garnish it with rice or jacket potatoes. Like many of these this is this is a dish that all of the work is in the prep and then the cooking can take as long or largely as short as you want. So find one of our biggest pans, put some oil in the bottom, drop a chopped onion, a chopped bell pepper, a chopped carrot, all the chopped celery and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt in and stir and combine it basically for like ten to seven minutes. Seven to ten minutes like just keep stirring it and make the veg nice and kind of like sauteed. Then add some garlic, some chili powder. Now with chili powder you probably don't want to add that much like this isn't a meal that is improved actually by chili it's probably weakened by chili so and be particularly careful with more spicy versions of chili. I'd recommend like a teaspoon of chili and then like two tablespoons of smoked paprika or paprika and a bit of oregano and two tablespoons of cumin. You can't overdo it on the cumin honestly. You'll just make it. It says like cook it for about a minute and that's probably a great idea. Now with the chopped tomatoes and the beans you can probably just don't bother draining any of them just empty all of them into the pot because this is probably like an effective way of doing it. So if they're like the beans come in water just like bang that all in bish-bash and let it kind of come to a simmer if you want. If you want you could add some a stock pot at this point to kind of extra add to the flavor and stodge of it all. This would be the right moment to do that. So keep cooking it keep stirring it don't let it stick to the bottom. Cook it probably for about 30 minutes or until you feel it's done. This could be longer than 30 minutes that's not a problem just don't let it stick to the bottom. So if you need to lower the heat then then that's fine. Honestly if you needed to kind of like leave this now for a couple of hours before you eat it that would be fine. Take it off from the chili from the heat sorry and ideally use like a stick blender to blend some proportion of it. Now you might like it blended super fine or you might like it blended more thick. Blend it to whatever you think is the right blendedness which may or may not be may soup consistency or or crunchy consistency it doesn't really matter. Give it a stir give it a taste. You might want to choose to add a little bit of vinegar or a bit of salt and serve it up. This will keep for some time and yeah it's a really kind of filling easy dish that you might want to make. It can feed large groups quite easily. Jane have you got any recipes you'd like to add? No because you said you don't like the sugar in them. What was the recipe you just did today? Enchiladas! Would you like to do that? You need a packet of enchilada stuff? Okay yeah we can do that. Right so tonight I made enchiladas. You need something for the filling. So today I did. something for the filling. So today I did. three peppers that I chopped into short strips and fried with some oil and a bit of little bit of a heat to spice you need a I also added some some leftover rice and a tin of sweet corn you need a enchilada kit a gluten free enchilada kit I think this one came from Aldi which contains a pack of gluten free tortillas and two sorts of sauce I mixed up my filling with a bit of the cooking sauce from the packet and then built my enchiladas with so you take the tortilla. Oh they all have to go in the tortillas have to go in the microwave just to make sure they're nice and soft. Then you take a tortilla, you put some of the filling in it, sprinkle a bit of cheese on and then pop it in a dish. So I used the big oblong pyrex that we've got and eight enchiladas will go in side by side quite neatly. There was a little bit of extra filling left so I plonked that at one end of all of my little filled tortillas. The packet contains a creamy topping sauce so that lodges all over the top and then a shed load of grated cheddar got shed on top of that and I baked it at 180 for about 15 minutes and it was very tasty. We had it with tortilla chips tonight. It could be quite nice with salad to lighten things up a little bit or if you wish to stodge up further it could be done with chips or wedges. Do you want to tell us how you make pilots? Pilots are a snack that James likes a lot and I like to for breakfast before work or when I'm going to work. So these are called pies. Pie-let like pilots, pilots, little pies. Pie-let, L-E-T-T-E rather than pilots like someone who's live playing. So take two ripe bananas, mash them well, add a mug of gluten-free oats, obviously to a bowl with the bananas. And two eggs and some sort of liquid. I've done them with kombucha when I've had some food with milk with water with fruit juice and they all kind of taste the same in the end, so add some sort of wet. I've made... I've... I've varied... I've done several variations on themes so I've done another one take Cole with colleg Pennкам done um sorry start now so you mix mix your ingredients together with whatever liquid you're using and then leave it for about an hour so that the oats absorb the liquid and then you can add whatever other ingredients you're using and pour them pour the mixture into to the silicon bun tins and bake them at 180 for about 30 to 35 minutes depending on how well filled they are um so recipe variations i have done um i have done kind of carrot cake one so i did grated carrot um but greek yogurt and cinnamon um they came out quite nicely but they needed a bit longer to cook because they were quite soggy um you can add i've added peanut butter as protein sauce just into the mix and then done those ones with either raspberries or blueberries you can use frozen ones but they tend to end up a bit soggy so i would tend to defrost the fruit that you're using in the mix um and again they hold together better if you put a bit of butter in the um in the bun tin then put the fruit on then put more more butter on the top um pardon me um another variation i've done is adding other fruits i've added bananas uh sorry i've added apples i've added pears um grated up i've added i've done um blueberries or blackberries or raspberries as the fruit in in sort of whole in them in in them um and i've done some with the batter and a layer of either cashew or almond butter and then more batter on the top um they tend to take a bit less time to cook because they're a bit smaller than the ones with fruit in let them cool completely in the tin in the in the bun tin before trying to get them out because if you try and get them out when they're hot they'll fall apart um and then stick them in a tupperware and in the fridge and they'll keep for five six days if they're not all been eaten by them um they're really easy and james likes helping to mix them so i'm going to add the rest of your breakfasts work breakfast then um so my standard work breakfast is some greek yogurt in a tupperware pot with a dessert spoon of peanut butter and this small squeeze of honey um a dessert spoon of peanut butter and a small squeeze of honey um with some fruit added to it so which is fairly often blueberries because i like them um and then granola and then that's the problem with things like this it's always a summer portion a sprinkling of granola added like as the last thing before i leave for work so it's still it's still crunchy and when i get to eat it so that's what i tend to have super can we think of any more recipes to add not for right now
