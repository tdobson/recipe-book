- It's a good option when you're not sure when someone will be home, as potatoes can be kept warm in the oven.
- Be careful not to overcook small potatoes in the microwave. Start with shorter bursts and adjust as needed.
- The microwave + oven method provides more flexibility in timing and can result in a crispier skin.
- For a complete meal, consider adding a side salad or vegetable dish.
