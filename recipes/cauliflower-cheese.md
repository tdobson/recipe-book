- 2-3 tablespoons butter
- A large amount of grated cheese 
- Salt and pepper to taste

- Knife for checking cauliflower
- Colander or strainer

## Preparation Time
- Prep: 15 minutes
- Cook: 20-25 minutes
- Total: 35-40 minutes

## Servings
Not specified in the transcript, but likely serves 3-4 people

## Instructions
1. Wash the cauliflower and cut it into florets about the size of a baby's hand.
2. Boil the cauliflower florets for 4-6 minutes, depending on their size. Check with a knife; they should be soft but not falling apart.
3. While the cauliflower is boiling, start the cheese sauce:
   - Put about a pint of milk in a pan.
   - Add 2-3 tablespoons of plain flour (gluten-free) and whisk until combined.
   - Put the pan on heat and add 2-3 tablespoons of butter.
   - Keep whisking until the sauce thickens.
4. Once the sauce is thick, cook for another couple of minutes.
5. Take the sauce off the heat and add a large amount of grated cheese. The recipe suggests 150g, but we use about twice that.
6. Add salt and pepper to taste.
7. Drain the cooked cauliflower well and let it dry out.
8. Pour the cauliflower into an ovenproof dish.
9. Pour the cheese sauce over the cauliflower.
10. Add some more grated cheese on top.
11. Bake in the oven at 180°C (350°F) for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is melted and the edges are bubbly.

## Notes
- You can include the cauliflower stems and leaves, but they will take longer to cook than the florets.
- The dish will be very hot when it comes out of the oven, so let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
- This recipe is gluten-free when using gluten-free flour.
