2. To reduce cooking time, microwave most of the vegetables before adding them to the curry.
3. Heat some oil in a wok or large pan.
4. Add some of the Thai Curry paste to the wok and fry it up a little.
5. Pour in some coconut milk and stir.
6. Add the vegetables that will take the longest to cook (e.g., carrot, broccoli stems) first.
7. Gradually add other vegetables, including butternut squash, spinach, and any other chosen vegetables.
8. Pour in the remaining coconut milk.
9. Let the curry simmer and cook for about 20-30 minutes.

    - Use about 1.5 mugs of rice.
    - Add water to cover the rice plus a bit extra.
    - Cook for 12 minutes, checking at 10 minutes to ensure there's enough water.
11. In the last 5 minutes of cooking the curry, add:
    - 1-2 handfuls of cashews
    - Water chestnuts
    - Any other last-minute ingredients

## Notes
- The wok we have is not that big, which can become a problem when cooking large quantities.
- Be careful not to add too many vegetables, as the wok may become too full.
- You can customize the curry with various vegetables, especially those that need to be used up soon.
- The cooking time for rice may vary; check it regularly and add more water if needed.
- Serve with gluten-free soy sauce, normal soy sauce, and optionally, plum Sharwood's sauce.
- Prawn crackers can be served as an optional side.
