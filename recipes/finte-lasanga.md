   - Cook on low heat for 30-40 minutes to reduce water content.
   - Season with garlic, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper to taste.
4. Layer the lasagna in a baking dish:
   - Start with a layer of the ricotta and spinach mixture.
   - Add a layer of sliced courgettes (these act as the "pasta" layers).
   - Repeat layers until all ingredients are used.
5. Finish with a layer of tomato sauce on top.
6. Sprinkle grated cheese over the top layer.
7. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 30-40 minutes, until bubbly and the cheese is melted.
