## Notes
- This recipe makes a large amount of food, suitable for feeding a big group.
- Be cautious with the chili powder - this dish isn't improved by being too spicy.
- You can't overdo it on the cumin - feel free to add more if desired.
- The cooking time is flexible - you can cook it for longer than 30 minutes if needed.
- If you need to leave it for a couple of hours before eating, that's fine.
- The consistency can be adjusted to your preference - blend more for a smoother chilli, or less for a chunkier texture.
- Serve with rice or jacket potatoes or nachos, avocado and salsa. Probably have sour cream too.
