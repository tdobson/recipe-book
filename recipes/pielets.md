## Notes
- For a carrot cake variation, add grated carrot, Greek yogurt, and cinnamon.
- For a protein boost, add peanut butter to the mixture.
- You can use fresh or frozen berries, but frozen ones may make the pielets a bit soggy.
- Experiment with different fruit combinations like apple, pear, blueberries, blackberries, or raspberries.
- For a nutty variation, try adding cashew or almond butter.
- The pielets hold together better if you put a bit of butter in the bun tins before adding the mixture.
